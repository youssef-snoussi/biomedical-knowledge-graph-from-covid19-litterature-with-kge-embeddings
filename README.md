# biomedical-knowledge-graph-from-covid19-litterature-with-kge-embeddings

this repository contains the codes and the report of my final projet in order to get my master's degree in BioInformatics and Modeling of Complex Systems related to Health (BioMSCS). The subject is constructing a biomedical knowledge graph from biomedical litterature, particularly, COVID19 scientific publications.
This research was conducted at the National School of Computer Science and System Analysis (ENSIAS) under the supervision of my professor ABIK MOUNIA>


This repository is organised under 2 folders, the first one contains the source code of realizing the project, the code of every task is under it's own folder.
For the NER task, the script will download the required files on its own, approximately 6.5 millons sentences, the output of this file is used in the RE task, and the the RE output is used for the graph exploration and KGE algorithms, just make sure to change the paths in the scripts.
